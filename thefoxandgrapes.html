    <h1>The Fox and Grapes</h1>
    <img src="sweet_grapes.jpg" style="height:400px; width:900px;">
    <p>On a warm late summer day, the proud fox roamed the countryside. His reddish-brown fur shone in the sun and a light wind blew through the surrounding bushes.
<br><br>
        Birds chirped in the trees and everything seemed peaceful and quiet. Looking for something to eat, the fox let his gaze wander through the area.
        <br><br>
        Since he hadn’t eaten anything all day, his stomach was grumbling. “I really need something to eat, otherwise I’ll starve to death!” thought the fox.
        <br><br>
        Suddenly he caught sight of a magnificent vine growing on the roof of the old farmhouse. Countless grapes were hanging from it, sparkling in the sun in a strong blue color. “That’s just the thing now!” the fox whooped and ran to the farm. 
        <br><br>
        From below, he could watch the little titmice and blackbirds snacking on one grape after another. They seemed to visibly enjoy them, as the birds couldn’t get enough of them.
        <br><br>
        “That’s a piece of cake for me,” thought the fox and took a few steps. With a great leap, he jumped up and reached for the grapes with his paw. 
        <br><br>
        But the fox missed the shining grapes and landed back on the ground without anything edible in his paws. 
        <br><br>
        “I guess I didn’t take enough of a running start. Two more steps and I’ll hold the whole vine in my paws,” he thought cockily.
        <br><br>
        But on his next attempt, his paws also grasped at nothing and he landed on the ground again without a grape. The fox tried again and again, but each of his attempts to pick a few grapes from the vine failed. 
        <br><br>
        Half an hour and countless jumps later, the fox was completely out of breath. Full of anger and defiance, he snorted, “Duh! I would make a real effort if these grapes were at least ripe and sweet. But these sour grapes are not worth my effort at all!”</p>
